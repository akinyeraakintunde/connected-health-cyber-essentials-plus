# Tech Nation Evidence – Cyber Essentials PLUS Contribution

This repository supports **Evidence 5** of my UK Global Talent Visa application  
(*Optional Criterion: Recognition for Work Beyond Normal Duties*).

It contains photos and documentation demonstrating my technical contribution to  
**Connected Health’s successful Cyber Essentials PLUS certification**.

## Why This Evidence Meets the Tech Nation Requirements

- **Direct technical contribution:**  
  I actively participated in the Cyber Essentials PLUS security audit, performing device security checks, MFA setup, endpoint hardening, and secure configuration across staff systems.

- **Recognition from management:**  
  The handwritten card included in this repository shows direct appreciation from Connected Health management for my work in achieving Cyber Essentials PLUS.

- **Work beyond day-to-day responsibilities:**  
  Cyber Essentials compliance required activities outside regular IT support work — including audit preparation, documentation, evidence gathering, and explaining technical configurations to assessors.

- **Verifiable real-world impact:**  
  My contribution helped the organisation achieve a nationally recognised UK Government-backed cybersecurity certification, demonstrating measurable impact.

- **Embedded in a UK tech environment:**  
  Photos included in this folder show my presence within the technical operations team, including the internal workspace and participation in company events.

- **Evidence aligns with cybersecurity expertise:**  
  Cyber Essentials work requires understanding of secure configuration, user access control, malware protection, firewalls, and patch management — skills directly relevant to digital technology.
