# Connected Health – Cyber Essentials & Cyber Essentials PLUS Contribution

This repository documents my technical contribution to helping **Connected Health** (a domiciliary healthcare provider in the UK and Ireland) prepare for and successfully achieve **Cyber Essentials** and Cyber Essentials PLUS accreditation.

The repo is structured as a formal evidence bundle for my **UK Global Talent (Digital Technology)** application, focusing on practical cybersecurity work in a live, regulated health-tech environment.

## 1. Context

**Organisation:** Connected Health, Belfast  
**Sector:** Domiciliary healthcare, operating across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland  
**Focus:** Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials PLUS readiness and assessment

Cyber Essentials is a UK Government–backed cybersecurity scheme that validates an organisation’s ability to meet strict requirements for:

- Device and endpoint security  
- Patch and update management  
- Access control and MFA  
- Secure configuration  
- Malware protection  
- Firewall and gateway security  

This repository provides a structured record of how I supported Connected Health in these areas as part of the certification process.

## 3. Summary of My Technical Contribution

As confirmed by the **Head of IT & Technology** at Connected Health (see recommendation letter referenced in the evidence PDF and TECH_NATION_EVIDENCE.md), my contribution focused on four main cybersecurity domains:

### 3.1 Device & Endpoint Security Checks
- Reviewing operating system versions and patch levels
- Verifying endpoint security tools (antivirus/EDR) were installed and active
- Checking firewall status and disk encryption where applicable
- Flagging non-compliant or misconfigured endpoints for remediation

### 3.2 Access & Identity Management
- Supporting reviews of user accounts and privilege levels
- Verifying MFA enforcement on core systems
- Identifying inactive or unnecessary accounts for deactivation
- Aligning access controls with organisational policies

### 3.3 Patch, Update & Configuration Support
- Assisting with patch cycles for Windows-based endpoints
- Supporting upgrades to bring devices and applications into compliance
- Helping staff resolve upgrade issues that would block security updates
- Feeding patch status and risks back to the Head of IT

### 3.4 Documentation & Audit Evidence
- Capturing screenshots of policy settings and security tooling
- Exporting relevant logs and configuration reports
- Helping compile the evidence pack mapped to Cyber Essentials controls
- Supporting internal review meetings to walk through the evidence set before assessment

These activities formed part of the organisation’s successful submission to the external Cyber Essentials assessor.

- Shows that I was trusted with tasks beyond basic IT support, directly tied to compliance outcomes
- Includes a formal recommendation letter from the Head of IT & Technology
- Shows recognition from management via a personal note thanking me for supporting Cyber Essentials PLUS
- Aligns with Tech Nation’s **Optional Criterion – Recognition for work beyond day-to-day activities**

## 5. How to Use This Repository

This repository is intended for:

- **Assessors** – to review my practical cybersecurity contribution in a clear, self-contained format  
- **Recruiters / hiring managers** – as a demonstration of hands-on security work in the health-tech sector  
- **Collaborators** – as a reference for the type of security and compliance projects I can support

There is no runtime code to execute here; instead, it serves as a **documentation and evidence bundle** linking narrative, recommendation letters, and visual proof.
