# 1. About Connected Health

Connected Health is a rapidly scaling health-technology and domiciliary care organisation headquartered in Belfast.  
It operates a hybrid workforce of caregivers, administrators, IT staff, clinical managers, and operational personnel.

Cyber Essentials PLUS is a **national-level cybersecurity accreditation** backed by the UK Government and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Achieving it is a signal of strong security governance, device protection, network hardening, and operational compliance.


# 2. My Cyber Essentials PLUS Contribution

During the certification process, I contributed technical support to the organisation’s cybersecurity and compliance team.

### **Key Responsibilities:**

### 🖥️ **2.1 Device Security & Configuration Review**  
- Conducted systems mapping of staff devices  
- Verified OS versions, update frequency, and patching automation  
- Helped validate AV/EDR presence and update status  
- Ensured device-encryption policies were active and compliant  

### 🔐 **2.2 MFA Rollout & Access Control Improvements**  
- Supported the expansion of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across core applications  
- Assisted with reviewing identity configurations  
- Helped ensure least-privilege access for administrative accounts  

### 🧩 **2.3 Vulnerability & Control Gap Analysis**  
- Highlighted outdated software with known CVEs  
- Identified unnecessary permissions and user-role misalignments  
- Conducted early analysis of phishing-risk exposure  
- Helped translate reports into remediation steps linked to CE control categories  

### 📚 **2.4 Documentation & Evidence Preparation**  
Prepared and organised certification-ready evidence for auditors:  
- Firewall configuration samples  
- Password-policy rewrite  
- Screenshots of device compliance  
- Patch-level summaries  
- Access management documentation  

This significantly reduced assessment time and improved the clarity and successful submission of the final evidence pack.
