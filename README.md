## 1. Overview

This evidence demonstrates my direct technical contribution to **Connected Health’s successful achievement of the UK Government–backed Cyber Essentials certification**. Connected Health is one of Northern Ireland’s largest domiciliary healthcare providers, operating in a highly regulated environment that requires strong cybersecurity practices across cloud systems, mobile devices, and digital-care infrastructure.

The evidence pack for this item includes:

- A formal recommendation letter from the **Head of IT & Technology** at Connected Health confirming my contribution.  
- Photographs showing my participation in the technical team, my workspace, and management recognition.  
- A detailed evidence document outlining the certification activities and control areas I helped to support.

## 2. About Connected Health

Connected Health operates across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, delivering technology-enabled domiciliary care services. The organisation manages sensitive patient and staff data across distributed devices, mobile applications, and cloud-based care platforms. Cybersecurity, infrastructure stability, and operational integrity are critical to both regulatory compliance and day-to-day service delivery.

**Cyber Essentials** is a UK Government–backed cybersecurity accreditation that validates an organisation’s ability to meet strict requirements for:

- Device and endpoint security  
- Patch and update management  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and access control  
- Secure configuration  
- Malware protection  
- Firewall and gateway security  

Successfully achieving Cyber Essentials demonstrates that an organisation has implemented and evidenced a strong baseline of technical and operational security controls.

## 3. My Specific Technical Contributions

As confirmed by the Head of IT & Technology, I contributed across four key cybersecurity domains during Connected Health’s Cyber Essentials readiness and assessment process.

### 3.1 Device & System Security Checks

I supported internal security assessments to ensure company devices met Cyber Essentials baselines:

- Reviewing operating system versions and patch levels.  
- Verifying that endpoint security tools (antivirus/EDR) were installed and active.  
- Checking firewall status and disk-encryption where required.  
- Flagging non-compliant or misconfigured endpoints for remediation.

These activities helped the organisation demonstrate that its endpoints were hardened and aligned with the Cyber Essentials device-security requirements.

---

### 3.2 Access & Identity Management

I contributed to strengthening the organisation’s identity and access management posture by:

- Assisting in the review of user accounts and privilege levels.  
- Supporting verification of MFA enforcement on core systems.  
- Identifying inactive, duplicate, or unnecessary accounts for deactivation.  
- Ensuring alignment with password and access-control policies.

This work fed into the Cyber Essentials control areas relating to secure access and account management.

---

### 3.3 Patch, Update & Configuration Support

I also helped coordinate and validate patch and configuration updates, including:

- Supporting patch cycles for Windows-based endpoints.  
- Assisting with operating system and application upgrades to bring devices into compliance.  
- Helping staff resolve upgrade issues that could have blocked security updates.  
- Providing feedback on patch status to the Head of IT and operations team.

Patch and update status formed a key part of the evidence presented to the external assessor.

---

### 3.4 Documentation & Audit Evidence Preparation

Finally, I contributed to the preparation of evidence for the Cyber Essentials assessor by:

- Capturing screenshots of policy settings, device-status dashboards, and MFA configurations.  
- Exporting relevant logs and system-information reports.  
- Helping compile evidence packs that linked technical configurations to specific Cyber Essentials control requirements.  
- Supporting internal review meetings with management to walk through the evidence set.

This documentation supported a smooth assessment process and ensured that the organisation’s technical posture was clearly demonstrated.

## 5. Alignment With Tech Nation’s Optional Criterion

This evidence supports **Optional Criterion 3 – Recognition for work outside of the applicant’s immediate occupation that contributes to the advancement of the sector**.

### How this evidence meets the criterion:

- My contributions took place within a **live UK health-tech organisation**, where cybersecurity is directly tied to patient safety and regulatory compliance.  
- I was trusted to support **high-impact cybersecurity tasks** (endpoint security, MFA, patching, and audit evidence) beyond basic support duties.  
- The organisation’s **Head of IT & Technology** provided a formal recommendation letter confirming the significance of my contribution and endorsing me for the Global Talent route.  
- Management issued **direct personal recognition** for my efforts in achieving Cyber Essentials, demonstrating appreciation beyond routine expectations.  
- The work contributed to a **nationally recognised cybersecurity outcome**, strengthening the resilience of a critical-care provider.

Taken together, this shows that my work at Connected Health is both technically meaningful and externally recognised, in line with the spirit of Tech Nation’s Optional Criterion 3.
