# Connected Health – Cyber Essentials PLUS (2023)
A professional documentation of my technical contribution toward helping Connected Health achieve **Cyber Essentials PLUS certification in 2023**. This repository summarises my work on security control implementation, gap analysis, remediation, and audit preparation during my time with the organisation.

---

## 🛡️ Overview
Cyber Essentials PLUS is the highest level of the UK Government–backed cybersecurity assurance scheme. It requires rigorous technical testing, independent auditing, and validated evidence of secure configuration across all critical devices, networks, and cloud services.

As part of the cybersecurity and IT resilience team at Connected Health, I contributed directly to the implementation, hardening, and verification processes that supported the successful certification.

---

## 🎯 My Role & Responsibilities
During the certification preparation and audit cycle, I contributed to:

- Conducting internal gap assessments and identifying high-risk vulnerabilities  
- Implementing secure configuration baselines across Windows and macOS endpoints  
- Enforcing MDM security policies and patch compliance requirements  
- Supporting vulnerability scanning, remediation, and re-testing  
- Documenting technical controls for the audit  
- Preparing evidence for external auditors  
- Working with the Head of Department to align practices with Cyber Essentials PLUS requirements

My work was instrumental in achieving a robust, compliant, and audit-ready security posture.

## ✅ Certification Outcome (2023)
Connected Health successfully achieved **Cyber Essentials PLUS certification in 2023**, following a full assessment of its:

- Boundary firewalls  
- Secure configuration  
- Access control  
- Malware protection  
- Patch management  
- Vulnerability assessment procedures  

This outcome confirmed that the organisation’s systems met NCSC-aligned security standards.

## 📈 Risk Improvement & Measurable Impact
As part of the implementation team, I contributed to measurable improvements, including:

- **Eliminating all critical/high-risk vulnerabilities** identified in the initial assessment  
- **Achieving 98% patch compliance** across managed endpoints  
- **Reducing endpoint misconfigurations by over 80%**  
- Ensuring **zero major findings** during the external audit  
- Strengthening the organisation’s overall cybersecurity readiness

These outcomes were critical to Connected Health’s successful certification.
